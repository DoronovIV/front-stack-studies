# About Language

In 1995 Netscape team has started their project on breaking the limit of static web-pages in form of a scripting language for their web-browser. *__Brendan Eich__* was hired for development of a java-based syntax language. The initial name was *__LiveScript__*, but was soon replaced in favor of *__JavaScript__*.

Until 2008 JS code was mainly interpreted. But with release of Google Chrome engine called *__V8__*, it was adapted for JIT. Some steps of its workflow are scripted though and have no premise of change.
