# Variable

> *__Variable__* is a container for storing and processing data.

There are three main keywords that are used for variable declaration in JavaScript:
- `var` - mostly considered as outdated. Enables reference hoisting by default.
- `let` - preferred alternative to *__var__*. It's key feature is that it is used to declare a block-scoped variable.
- `const` - a readonly version of *__let__*.
